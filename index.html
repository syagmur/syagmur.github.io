        I earned BS degrees in Mathematical Engineering and Electronics Engineering from Istanbul Technical University. 
        Subsequently, I pursued an MS in Computer Science and Engineering at Sabanci University. 
        Following my PhD in Cognitive Systems at Northeastern University under Deniz Erdogmus in 2020, I joined Philips Ultrasound as a Systems Design Engineer, 
        where I developed GPU signal processing algorithms. Before returning to Philips in December 2024, I served as a Sr. Applied AI/ML Scientist at Inari Medical, 
        developing blood flow detection algorithms for IntraVascular Ultrasound (IVUS) images. 
        My ongoing research interests center around biomedical signal processing and algorithm optimization, with a particular interest in leveraging GPU acceleration for real-time applications.
