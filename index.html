        I received my BS degrees from Istanbul Technical University in Mathematical Engineering and Electronics Engineering with a double major program. 
        I also received my MS degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Sabanci University. After I completed my PhD in the 
        Cognitive Systems Lab at Northeastern University under the supervision of Deniz Erdogmus in 2020, I joined Philips Ultrasound Inc. as 
        Systems Design Engineer and developed algorithms for the GPU signal path. Currently, I am a Sr. Applied AI/ML Scientist 
        at Inari Medical Inc., where I develop learning-based solutions for biomedical images. My current research interests include image quality 
        assessment and biomedical signal processing.
